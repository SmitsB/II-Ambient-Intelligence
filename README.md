This git will be a storage for the final portfolio of the course.
The different parts in this git:

1) Design of Project:
Basic design of the entire project

2) Documentation:
A small overview on all the used technologies, implementations and source code. This is so everybody knows what everybody has been doing over the past weeks. Don't go into too much detail but enough to know what it's about and how it's implemented.

3) Source Code:
All the final code running on both the STM-boards as on the Raspberry Pi 3

4) Powerpoints:
Not yet sure if we want to share these.
